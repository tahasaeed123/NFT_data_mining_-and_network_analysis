# NFT_data_mining_-and_network_analysis

### **About** ###
To better understand the NFT space, our team has collected sales, tweets, and network data for NFTs on Ethereum, the most popular blockchain platform to host NFTs.  Throughout the project, we will be looking into:

- An overview of how revenue and user base are distributed across **projects**
- Success of specific NFT projects in terms of **sales** and **user growth**
- A detailed **network analysis** on Ethereum NFTs
- **Sentiment** and **language** used in the NFT twitter space
  - Term-frequency & Sentiment Analysis
  - Topic modeling (LDA)

(Note: we used the reveal.javascript presetation framework in RMarkdown so there are lots of automatically generated files that are messy to handle with. For your convenience, please just click RMarkdown and knitted HTML files, or even simpler, check the published GitHub page based on the RMarkdown file.)
